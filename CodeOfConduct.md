Code of Conduct
===============

We have developed this Code of Conduct to specify minimum expectations of appropriate behavior for each team member. At any time we can modify or supplement this Code of Conduct and file it with the instructor. At that time, the revision will become effective, and the previous version will be void.

The following repercussions may be applied to any team member who fails to meet the minimum level of performance specified in the Code of Conduct:

The first time a team member fails to meet their responsibilities, the team should meet with the neglectful member, and file a Status Update with the action Warning One. This warning will describe the specific violations of the Code of Conduct, provide suggestions for improving their performance, and list metrics to evaluate improved future performance (i.e. the warning must make the group's expectations explicit). The form must be signed by all team members and given to the instructor.

The second infraction by a team member should result in a Status Update with the action Warning Two. This warning will summarize the history of the problem and corrective actions that have been attempted. It also must provide a specific plan of action to help the member meet his/her responsibilities. The actions in the plan must be quantitative to guarantee that there are no misunderstandings about the requirements. Again, this form must be given to the instructor. The instructor will be available for mediation if desired by any team member. When this document is filed, the team agrees to review the member's progress in exactly one week.

Within one week following a Warning Two, the team must file a Status Update with one of three actions:
* Clear Problem indicates that the member has satisfied the action plan specified in the warning, and clears the member's record.
* Continue Monitoring indicates that progress is being made but the problem is not yet resolved.
* Move to Terminate indicates that the problem has not been resolved, and the team must schedule a final mediation session. If the session results in termination, then the delinquent member will be removed from the team, and will have to seek employment on the open market. If s/he fails to find employment, s/he will receive no credit for future team activities.
